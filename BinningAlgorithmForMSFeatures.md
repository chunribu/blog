# Binning Algorithm for MS Features

---

Merge feature maps from differrent experiments into a consensus matrix.

The algorithm is based on the following workflow:

1. Put all mass in a sorted vector.
2. Calculate differences between each neighbor.
3. Divide the mass vector at the largest gap (largest difference) and form a left and a right bin.
4. Rerun step 3 for the left and/or the right bin if they don‚Äôt fulfill the following criteria:
    + All peaks in a bin are near to the mean (abs(mass-meanMass)/meanMass < tolerance).

The new peak positions (mass value) are the mean mass of a bin.

class Precursor:
    def __init__(self, sample, mz, intensity, rt):
        self.sample = sample
        self.mz = mz
        self.intensity = intensity
        self.rt = rt
    def __repr__(self):
        return repr(self.mz)

def is_near_to_mean(_list, tol):
    mz_list = [p.mz for p in _list]
    mean_mz = sum(mz_list) / len(mz_list)
    diff = max(max(mz_list)-mean_mz, mean_mz-min(mz_list))
    if diff > tol:
        return False
    return True

    mz_list = [p.mz for p in _list]
    gaps = []
    length = len(mz_list)
    for i in range(length-1):
        gaps.append(mz_list[i+1]-mz_list[i])

        left, right = _list[:break_point], _list[break_point:]
